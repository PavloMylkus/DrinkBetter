					These Big Guys may own and control smaller winery entities that seem like they’re still
					family-owned, or use white label practices (hello, two buck chuck!) to create snappy, on-trend
					bottles that are nothing more than overpriced alcoholic grape juice - not wine.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>What you may not realize - your grocery store mass-produced wine could have up to 72 ingredients
						other than grapes.</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					These wines come from huge swaths of land (particularly central California and Provence), with
					“terroir” that’s barely suitable to grow anything at all. To cut on costs, these bulk wines are
					often made from rotten or low-quality grapes, under-ripe fruit, or even wine by-products. Then, to
					hide or “fix” this quality issue, the wine is typically treated like a chemistry experiment or lab
					formula. Mass-produced laboratory yeasts mask subpar grapes by adding unnatural aromas to the wine
					and speeding along fermentation, wood chips are used to add an oaky flavor and cut costs when oak
					barrels are too expensive, chemicals and dyes are added to chase the desired color, all to achieve
					the same, standard (read: boring) taste year-after-year.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>When we buy wine made by these conglomerates, it puts small, family-owned wineries out of
						business,
						& perpetuates the negative cycle.</b>
